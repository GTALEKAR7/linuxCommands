[ ssh-keygen ]
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -C "<email ID>"      # Generate a New SSH Key Pair (Default RSA)
ssh-copy-id user@remote-server      # Copy SSH Key to a Remote Server (for Passwordless Login)
# sshd logs are typically stored in /var/log/secure file
journalctl -u sshd  # to check the sshd logs

[ sed (String editor) ]
sed 's/<string_from_the_file>/<string_that_you_want_to_replace/' filename.txt       # Here s indicates string value and will makes changes in filename. Note: this does not actually modify the file but rather just give replaced output
sed -i 's/<string_from_the_file>/<string_that_you_want_to_replace/' filename.txt      # -i will make changes in file

[ awk ]
# awk command assumes that each space between words as delimitter
awk '{print}' filename.txt      # will just print the file as it is
awk '{print $1}' filename.txt        # prints the first word of the column
awk '{print $1,$3}' filename.txt     # prints the first and third column of the file
awk '{print $NF}' filename.txt       # prints last column of the file
awk -F':' '{print $1}' /etc/passwd      # -F makes : as the delimitter instead of space

[ cut ]
cut -b 1 filename.txt       # prints the first char of the file. -b is for byte
cut -b 7,8,9,10,11 filename.txt     # prints characters from 7 to 11 of the file
cut -b 7-11 filename.txt            # prints char from 7 to 11 of the file
cut -c 7-11 filename.txt            # -c is to output char from 7th char to 11th char. In few cases the output will be same as -b argument
cut -d " " -f 1,2 filename.txt      # -d is for delimitter and f is for fields. In this case it will print first two words of the file

[ vagrant ]
vagrant init    # creates a Vagrantfile in the current working directory
vagrant init ubuntu/jammy64     # creates a Vagrantfile with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as the base OS
vagrant up      # starts the VM using the provider (default is VirtualBox)
vagrant ssh     # Logs into the running VM
vagrant suspend   # Pause the VM (saves state)
vagrant halt      # Shut down the VM
vagrant destroy   # Completely remove the VM
