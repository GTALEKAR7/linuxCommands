[ awk ]
# awk command assumes that each space between words as delimitter
awk '{print}' filename.txt      # will just print the file as it is
awk '{print $1}' filename.txt        # prints the first word of the column
awk '{print $1,$3}' filename.txt     # prints the first and third column of the file
awk '{print $NF}' filename.txt       # prints last column of the file
awk -F':' '{print $1}' /etc/passwd      # -F makes : as the delimitter instead of space
