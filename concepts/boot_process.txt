BIOS -> MBR -> GRUB -> Kernel -> SystemD


BIOS
- Basic I/0 system.
- First Program that executes which is stored in read-only memory on motherboard of computer.
- Perform POST (power-on self-test) verify the hardware components and peripheral to ensure if computer is in working condition.
- Check for bootable device like pendrive, hardisk etc.
- Handover control to first sector of device i.e. MBR
Apart from BIOS, UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is used.


MBR
- Master Boot Record
- 512 bytes, first sector of any bootable device contains machine code instructions to boot a machine and having following info
    . Boot loader (446 bytes)
    . Partition Table (64 bytes)
    . Error Checking (2 bytes)
- It will load the boot loader(GRUB) into the memory and handover to it

GRUB
- Grand Unified Bootloader
- Load /boot/grub2/grub.cfg at boot time
- At this stage, User will see GUI asking different OS or kernels configured to boot.
- Once you selected the kernel, it locates the corresponding kernel binary    /boot/vmlinuz-< kernel-version>
- Main job is to load kernel and initrd/initramfs image into memory
- Once load kernel in RAM, it passes control to it
In RHEL7
    . Default boot loader is GRUB2
    . GRUB is for x86 architecture, it could be different for others arch like for Intel Itanium - ELILO

Kernel
- First kernel is loaded into read-only mode
- Initramfs/initrd gets decompressed and then it first loads temporary file system.
- Initrd then detects and load the drivers from temporary filesystem to load actual file system.
- Mount other partitions like LVM, RAID etc and unmount itself.
- Once main filesystem is mounted, kernel initialize the first process init/SystemD
- You can find these images under /boot folder


SystemD
- First service loaded with process ID 1
- Start all required processes  /etc/systemd/system/default.target
- To bring the system to the run-level/targets (0-6)
- You can find the different runlevels files under
    . /usr/lib/systemd/system
    . ls -l runlevel*


Runlevel    Target Units                            Description
0           runlevelo.target/poweroff.target        Power off the system.
1           runlevel1.target/rescue.target          Single User mode without GUI, without networking.
2           runlevel2.target/multi-user.target      multi-user mode without GUI, without networking.
3           runlevel3.target/multi-user.target      multi-user mode without GUI, but with networking.
4           runlevel4.target/multi-user.target      multi-user mode (for research use only).
5           runlevel5.target/graphical.target       Graphical mode multiuser, with networking.
6           runlevel6.target/reboot.target          Reboot the system.
