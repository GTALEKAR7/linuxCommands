strace -- command

concept: 
- Every user-space program relies on the kernel to access hardware and system resources. The bridge between user programs and the kernel is the system call (syscall).
- strace is a powerful tool to trace syscalls made by a process. It’s extremely useful for debugging issues like:
  1. Why a program can’t find a config file
  2. Permission errors
  3. Library or socket failures

Note: need to install "strace" utility

Uses of strace command:
1. Debugging Application Behavior
    - Shows which system calls a program makes (e.g., open, read, write, socket).
    - Useful to see if a program is failing due to missing files, permissions, or wrong paths.
    - eg. $strace ./my_program
2. Troubleshooting "File Not Found" Errors
    - Tracks file access attempts (openat, stat, etc.) to see exactly which file path the program is looking for
    - eg. $strace -e openat ./app
