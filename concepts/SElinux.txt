SElinux(Security Enhanced linux)
- Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is an implementation of a mandatory access control mechanism in the Linux kernel, checking for allowed operations after standard discretionaryaccess controls are checked. It was created by the National Security Agency and can enforce rules on files and processes in a Linux system, and on their actions, based on defined policies.

- When using SELinux, files, including directories and devices, are refered to as objects. Processes, such as a user running a command or any application, are refered to as subjects. Most OS use a Discretionary Acess Control (DAC) system. It controls how the subjects interact with objects, and how objects interact with each other in OS using DAC, users control the permissions of the files(objects). Relying on DAC mechanisms alone is fundamentally inadequate for system security since they are only on user identity and ownership.

- SELinux adds Mandatory Access Control (MAC) to the linux kernel. It can limit the damage that can result from exploitation of vulnerabilities

ls -Z file.txt      # Labes containing security relevant information that are on processes, Linux users and files are called SELinux context.
