SElinux(Security Enhanced linux)
- Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is an implementation of a mandatory access control mechanism in the Linux kernel, checking for allowed operations after standard discretionary access controls are checked. It was created by the National Security Agency and can enforce rules on files and processes in a Linux system, and on their actions, based on defined policies.

- When using SELinux, files, including directories and devices, are refered to as objects. Processes, such as a user running a command or any application, are refered to as subjects. Most OS use a Discretionary Access Control (DAC) system. It controls how the subjects interact with objects, and how objects interact with each other in OS using DAC, users control the permissions of the files(objects). Relying on DAC mechanisms alone is fundamentally inadequate for system security since they are only on user identity and ownership.

- SELinux adds Mandatory Access Control (MAC) to the linux kernel. It can limit the damage that can result from exploitation of vulnerabilities

ls -Z file.txt      # Lables containing security relevant information that are on processes, Linux users and files are called SELinux context

ps -efZ|grep <pid>      # -Z provides here SELinux context for the process 

===============================================================================================
for example below:
[root@cent-node1 vagrant]# ls -Z Vagrantfile
unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0 Vagrantfile

unconfined_u is selinux user
object_r is the role
default_t is the type of file(usually shows which user and the directory where it is created)
s0 represents the security level of this file
===============================================================================================

SELinux modes:
- Enforcing :- SELinux policy is enforced. SELinux denies access based on SELinux policy rules
- Permissive :- SElinux policy is not enforced. SELinux does not deny access but denails are logged for actions that would have been denied if running in enforcing mode
- Disabled :- SElinux is disabled. Only DAC rules will be used

===============================================================================================
- setenforce utility is used to set the SELinux modes
- getenforce is used to check which SELinux mode is currently being used
- Though these are temprorary changes and will set to default post reboot

getenforce      # This command will show which SElinux mode is currently being used
setenforce 0    # Will set SELinux to Permissive mode
setenforce 1    # Will set SELinux to enforcing mode

- The configuration file for SELinux is in the path /etc/selinux/config
