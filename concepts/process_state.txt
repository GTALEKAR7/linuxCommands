Every process in Linux has a state, which tells you what it’s doing (or waiting for). These states show up when you run tools like ps or top.
The most common codes:
  - R (Running/Ready) → process is executing on CPU or waiting to be scheduled
  - S (Sleeping) → waiting for an event (e.g., disk I/O, network)
  - D (Uninterruptible Sleep) → usually waiting on hardware I/O; cannot be killed until it finishes
  - T (Stopped/Traced) → paused (e.g., with kill -STOP) or being debugged
  - Z (Zombie) → process has finished, but parent hasn’t reaped it yet
  - I (Idle) → kernel threads waiting for work

 ps -eo pid,stat,cmd --sort=stat    # lists all processes with their states
 
 ps -o ppid= -p <zombie_pid>    # To check the parent process of zombie pid
