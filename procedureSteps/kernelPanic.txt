[ To regenrate initramfs file ]
# first go into rescue mode
# now rebuild the initramfs file for the kernel that is corrupted
dracut -f initramfs-<kernel-version>.img <kernel-version>       # this will rebuild the initramfs file. -f can be used if the file already exists and we want to overite it.
# now check in /boot if the file is recreated
grubby --default-kernel     # verify the right kernel version is set as default
reboot now  # restart the system and choose the right kernel in grub menu


[ To regenrate initramfs file using grub ]
# In grub boot menu press 'c'. This will take you to grub cli
ls  # This will give the partition info
set root=(hd0,msdos1)
linux16 /vmlinuz-<kernel-version> roo=/dev/mapper/centos-root ro    # make sure to select the old working kernel version
initrd16 /initramfs-<kernel-version>.img    # make sure to select the old working kernel version
boot
# This will boot the system to the old working kernel version and from there now you can reinstall the corrupted kernel version using yum/dnf
