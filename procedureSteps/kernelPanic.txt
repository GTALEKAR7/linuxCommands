[ To regenrate initramfs file ]
# first go into rescue mode
# now rebuild the initramfs file for the kernel that is corrupted
dracut -f initramfs-<kernel-version>.img <kernel-version>       # this will rebuild the initramfs file. -f can be used if the file already exists and we want to overite it.
# now check in /boot if the file is recreated
grubby --default-kernel     # verify the right kernel version is set as default
reboot now  # restart the system and choose the right kernel in grub menu
